Star ‚≠ê the repo if you like what you seeüòâ.

I created particles which follow simple netwon law's of motion. The particles are attracted to each other and repel each other. 

The particles are attracted to each other by a force which is inversely proportional to the distance between them. The particles repel each other by a force which is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
